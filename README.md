## Reflection

This was a 3 week long final project built at Avion School. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.
<br><br>
Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to remember all of their funds in different wallets and exchanges. I started this process by using the create-react-app, and using Ruby on Rails in the backend.
<br><br>
One of the main challenges I ran into was the calculations of Pnl and Overall Worth. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into how to manipulate simple back end data and transforming it into a user friendly UI. Due to project time constraints, the stablecoin percentage feature was not yet implemented.
<br><br>
At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Ruby on Rails and a significant amount of bootstrap, Javascript, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan to connect the project on web3 wallets like Metamask.
